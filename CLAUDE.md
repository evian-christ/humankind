# CLAUDE.md

This repository now uses a three-layer documentation stack:

1. `README.md` – onboarding info, contributor rules, project structure, quickstart.
2. `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` – detailed rundown of implemented systems, resource/combat flow, roadmap.
3. `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md` – long-term design goals, synergy ideas, external references.

Please read the documents in that order. The mandatory rules remain:
- Do **not** run `git commit`/`git push` without explicit user approval.
- All replies to the user must be written in Korean.

All previous guidance that used to live in this file has been migrated to the three docs above. Use them as the single source of truth.
